## 2. UXD â€“ User Experience Design

Most celebrations or special occasions call for amazingly delicious cakes, be it a birthday, wedding, anniversaries, farewell, etc. For any celebration, cakes are the best choice, and they are suitable for any place and at any time.We specialize in custom designed
birthday cakes and wedding cakes. We also offer a variety of cupcakes, dessert cakes, and cookies.

### Strategy

#### Customer Goals

Visitors to this website are searching for easy to follow cakes for different clebrations and snack items that promises a delicious and aesthetically pleasing outcome.

#### Project Goals

This project is the best way to help them achieve this because it is easy to navigate, whether by mobile, tablet, or desktop. The navigation bar is always in the viewport no matter where in the site the user has navigated to.

The site is designed so that upon entering, the user immediately anticipates a sense of deliciousness and feels inspired enough to order - being the ultimate goal of this website.

#### User Stories

1. As a site visitor, I wish to understand how to navigate this site, so that I can find what I am looking for easily.
2. As a site visitor, I wish to view this site on all my devices.
3. As a site visitor, I wish to feel inspired by what I see and find on this site.
4. As a site visitor, I wish to be able to order and also customize a variety of cupcakes, dessert cakes and wedding cakes.
5. As a site visitor, I wish to have visible access to social media, so I can follow and be a part of the community.

### Scope

For the initial release of this website, I have decided on a "Minimal Viable Product" approach - considering my current skill set is at beginner level.

Features include:

- The ability to navigate with ease through a single page site; either by scrolling through the various sections, or by clicking on the links on the navigation bar - which is always in view.
- An eye catching pleasing **Home** page.
  A **About us** section describes what best they will do for the customers.
  A **OUR SPECIALS** section to grab the user's attention.
  A **OUR SPECIALS** section to grab the user's attention.
  A **CONTACT US** form for more variety of cupcakes, customized cakes.
  A **OUR Team** section to grab the user's attention to know who is behind the delicious variety of cupcakes, customized cakes. .
- A footer with a copyright and social media links for user to interact and become a customer of Infinity Platter.

### Structure

I have intentionally created a single page website with minimal written content in order for the user not to feel overwhelmed, but rather inspired.

The **Home** sections features a hero image with a navigation bar, and a small piece of information inviting the user to discover the cakes below.
The pictures in the **OUR SPECIALS** section are purely for aesthetic purposes, for any celebration.
The **OUR SPECIALS** section features:-

- several desserts for different clebrations.
- each with a picture of the dessert
- a short but tantalizing description

The **Contact Us** form is simple and clean.

The footer features linked icons for ease of access to social media,contact details and a newsletter to get our news and updates.
